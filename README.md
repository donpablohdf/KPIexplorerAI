# KPIexplorer AI
KPIexplorer AI is an application that uses artificial intelligence techniques to identify new KPIs and eliminate irrelevant ones. The application allows users to monitor and analyze the performance of different processes and areas of their business in real time, enabling them to make more informed and effective decisions.

## Features

Intuitive and user-friendly interface for adding, modifying, and deleting KPIs.
Graphs and visualizations to view KPI performance.
Real-time notifications when a KPI is outside the desired range.
Machine learning algorithms to identify relevant new KPIs and eliminate unnecessary ones.
Integration with different data sources such as enterprise databases, spreadsheets, and third-party systems.

Data collection: The application collects production, maintenance, and other relevant variables data from the company using automatic or manual data collection technologies.

Data preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed using tools like Pandas and Numpy to clean and prepare it for use in data analysis and predictive modeling.

Data analysis: The preprocessed data is analyzed using AI technologies like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow to identify patterns and trends in historical data.

Predictive modeling: Machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, and neural networks are used to train predictive models that can predict future production and expenditure, taking into account historical data.

KPI selection: Based on the analysis and predictive modeling results, relevant KPIs are selected for monitoring and improvement.

Dashboard creation: A dashboard is created using Flask and React to display the selected KPIs in real-time and provide actionable insights for decision-making.

Continuous improvement: The application continually monitors and analyzes data, updating predictive models and KPIs as necessary to optimize production efficiency and reduce maintenance costs.
